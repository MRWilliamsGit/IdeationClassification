Feeling inferiorSocial media makes me feel so inferior to other people. It highens my levels of anxiety that makes me even more scared to socialize. And I feel like people like to bully people like me who's trying to get better so no one can get to their level and gain the attention that they've got just so I don't shine as they do.

Humans are so greedy deep down in the core. This capitalistic society we live in is very unfair to most. Social media just makes it even worse. We compare ourselves to other people and think we're not as unlovable as them. It's truly fucked up if you think about it.

I want social media to go. Someone please abolish social media. It's ruining MANY peoples lives. Most people are just surviving and dissociating from their present moment to forget the struggle that they have to go through in their life.

Gosh. Life is so unfair.
